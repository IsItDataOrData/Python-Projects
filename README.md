## Python-Projects
This repository consists of different Python projects I have worked on to improve my programming skills.

Port Scanner.py:     This is a program used to check what ports within a given range are open on an IP or Domain input by the user.
                      I created this tool to demonstrate my ability to build a port scanner that can enumerate the number of open ports
                      on a given Doman or IP. Port scanners are valuable tools for ensuring your network is properly protected and no 
                      unneccesary ports are open that may be vulnerable to outside threats. 

CSVReaderpractice.py: The program builds a GUI for the user to select the CSV file they would like to gather info from. It then prints out 
                      the result in 3 different formats providing more specific information about the CSV file. The result of each value set 
                      is also saved to individual text files. I created this program to demonstrate my ability to take the information from 
                      certain files (such as log files) and extrapolate specific information and saves it to a file. I've attached a CSV file
                      labeled CSVPortScanHistory as an example to allow users to test the program.
                      The program is accompanied by 3 class files (CSVTrackByCount_Class.py, CSVTrackByDate_Class.py, CSVTrackByIP_Class.py) 
                      *Note you may need to install the breezypythyongui package for it to work properly.
                       

Luck Seven Game.py:   This program creates a game using 2 random dice. The user enters the amount they would like to wager (1-100).
                      The final result will tell the user how many times the dice were rolled and what the maximum amount they had 
                      during the duration of the game.
